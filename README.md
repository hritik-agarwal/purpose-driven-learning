# Purpose-Driven Learning Path

## Purpose & Methodology

I want to become the best of the best coder in the world and architect digital experiences that change how people interact with this world.

### Core Methodology for Upskilling

1. **Project-Driven Learning** ðŸ¤–  
   No more learning stuff randomly or even for the sake of building "future" projects. Build stuff to learn stuff and not the other way around.

2. **Quantity over Quality** ðŸ¦–  
   Especially in the beginning, I want to focus on building tons of applications in various domains and technologies instead of few good projects.
